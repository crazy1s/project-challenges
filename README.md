# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ to Project-Challenges

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

This project-challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

Also, you could try building this project in a team. This is a great way to practice collaborative coding.

**To do these challenges, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and (sometimes) JavaScript.**

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` `Project` folder.
You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

If you would like the Sketch file in order to see sizes etc, it is available to download from the challenge page.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

### Sharing your solution

There are multiple places you can share your solution:

1-Send me a Pull Request from your **/finished-projects** folder of the challenge.
[Pull Request Tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/como-criar-um-pull-request-no-github-pt)

2-Practice using version control by creating your own GitHub repository for this challenge. This has the added benefit of being able to publish the site for free on GitHub Pages. Find out more about GitHub Pages here: [https://pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com).

3-Other Platforms [Codepen.io](https://Codepen.io) [Repl.it](https://Repl.it) [Codesandbox.io](https://Codesandbox.io) [Gitpod.io](https://Gitpod.io)

Submit it on a platform so that other users will see your solution on the site.
Other users will be able to give you feedback, which could help improve your code for the next project.


## Giving feedback

Feedback is always welcome.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
